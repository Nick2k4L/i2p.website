Overview
========

This proposal exposes new information to the i2pcontrol API, allowing for greater flexibility. This information includes: adding, deleting, retrieving, and modifying addressbooks, and hidden services. This proposal also exposes more information about your router, such as, peers, news, netdb, and more.

Motivation
==========

The reason for this proposal is to allow for greater flexibility in the I2P API for applications to implement and manage an I2P administrative interface. Exposing such information to i2pcontrol allows for users to create more advanced applications and provide better support for remote management.

Design
======

When users interact with the i2pcontrol API, they will be able to access new endpoints that provide the information mentioned above. For example, the i2pcontrol API will expose new methods `TunnelManager` and `AddressBook` that will allow users to enter parameters to create, delete, retrieve, and modify tunnels and addressbooks. Additionally, the pre-existing `RouterInfo` method will have new parameters to expose information about the router.

Security implications
=====================

There are no expected additional security implications from this proposal, as the information being exposed is already accessible through other means. However, it is important to ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for accessing the i2pcontrol API, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or control over the router.

API Specification & Methods
===========================

All requests follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "MethodName",

Method - ClientServicesInfo *(adopted from i2pd)*
-------------------------------------------------

The `ClientServicesInfo` method returns status information about client services running on the router. Include the desired service keys (with any value) in `params` to request each service's status.

Supported parameters:

- `I2PTunnel` - returns a map of configured tunnel names to their addresses, split into `client` and `server` sub-objects.
- `HTTPProxy` - returns HTTP proxy enabled state and address.
- `SOCKS` - returns SOCKS proxy enabled state and address.
- `SAM` - returns SAM bridge enabled state and active session information.
- `BOB` - returns BOB bridge enabled state. (Deprecated in Java I2P; always returns `false`.)
- `I2CP` - returns I2CP server enabled state.

Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "ClientServicesInfo",
  "params": {
    "I2PTunnel": "",
    "SAM": ""
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Return:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "I2PTunnel": {
      "client": {"my-client": {"address": "example.b32.i2p"}},
      "server": {"my-server": {"address": "example.b32.i2p", "port": 8080}}
    },
    "SAM": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sessions": {}
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Compatibility
=============

Compatibility with the existing i2pcontrol API should be maintained, as the new methods and parameters are added in a way that does not interfere with existing functionality. Existing applications using the i2pcontrol API should continue to work without modification, while new applications can take advantage of the additional information and capabilities provided by this proposal.

Implementation
==============

Java I2P
--------

This proposal is not yet implemented in Java I2P, yet the code is available in the [i2p.plugins.i2pcontrol](https://github.com/i2p/i2p.plugins.i2pcontrol) repository under pull request [#6](https://github.com/i2p/i2p.plugins.i2pcontrol/pull/6). This was done to allow for testing and development of the new methods without affecting the existing code. This will be updated into the main I2P repository under i2pcontrol directory once the code is ready for production use.

i2pd
----

Methods and parameters marked as "(adopded from i2pd)" are implemented in i2pd and unchanged in this proposal. i2pd's extensions will not require modification as part of this proposal. Unmarked parts of this proposal are not implemented in i2pd.

go-i2p
------

go-i2p is motivated to pursue this proposal in order to enable and enhance it's router console application. It will adopt and implement the proposal in the future.

emissary
--------

Likelihood of adoption in emissary is unknown at this time, however emissary is likely to benefit from this proposal in the same ways as go-i2p.

Performance
===========

No performance impact expected.
