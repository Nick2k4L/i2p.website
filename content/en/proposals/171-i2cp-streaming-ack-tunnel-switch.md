## Overview

I2CP client connections can become stalled when delivery acknowledgments
are silently lost. The sender retransmits until an acknowledgment is
received or the connection is torn down, with no reliable way to confirm
that acknowledgments are reaching the other side.
This proposal adds one new flag bit to the
[SendMessageExpiresMessage](/docs/specs/i2cp/)
flags field so that a client can instruct the router to select a different
outbound tunnel for subsequent messages to the same destination.

## Triggers

Two conditions SHOULD prompt the client to set the flag on the next
outbound message:

**Sender side**

No acknowledgment has been received within the client's current
retransmit timeout period.

**Receiver side**

The receiver has observed the remote retransmitting the same data
more than once, indicating that its acknowledgments are not reaching
the remote. The receiver SHOULD set this flag on its next outbound
I2CP message so that acknowledgments reach the remote via a different
path. The receiver MUST wait until: (1) it has received a duplicate,
(2) it has sent at least one acknowledgment, and (3) the remote has
retransmitted again before setting the flag.

To limit timing-correlation attacks, a client MUST NOT set the flag
more than once per 10-second window per connection. The client SHOULD
also delay setting the flag by a jitter drawn uniformly from
`[0, min(T/4, 2000ms)]`, where T is the client's current retransmit
timeout in milliseconds, after detecting the stall condition, to reduce
timing-correlation precision.

## Specification

The flags field of [SendMessageExpiresMessage](/docs/specs/i2cp/) occupies the upper 2 bytes
after the Date field (redefined as of release 0.8.4) and is transmitted
big-endian. Bit 15 is currently unused; this proposal defines it.

Bit order: 15...0

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 15 | SWITCH_OUTBOUND_TUNNEL | If 1, the router SHOULD select a different outbound tunnel from its pool for subsequent messages to this destination. If no alternate tunnel is available, this flag is silently ignored. The router MUST NOT close or retire the previously-used tunnel solely because this flag was set. |

This flag defaults to 0. Routers that do not implement it MUST ignore it
without error.

## Implementation Notes

When `SWITCH_OUTBOUND_TUNNEL` is set, the router SHOULD select a tunnel
uniformly at random from the outbound pool, excluding:

- the tunnel currently in use for this session, and
- the single most recently failed tunnel in the pool, if any.

All other tunnel health metrics, build times, or selection history
MUST NOT influence the choice, as weighted selection could favor sybil
attackers. If the pool contains no eligible tunnel after these
exclusions the flag is silently ignored.

This flag incurs no additional tunnel messages; switching tunnels may
change apparent latency. The 10-second per-connection rate limit
(see Triggers) prevents excessive switching.

## Anonymity Considerations

The flags in [SendMessageExpiresMessage](/docs/specs/i2cp/) are carried over I2CP, which
is a local interface between the client and its own router. They are not
visible to network observers.

The anonymity risk is traffic-pattern-based: an adversary with visibility
across multiple tunnel endpoints can observe *when* tunnel usage changes.

Switching outbound tunnels in direct response to a client-side stall
creates a detectable behavioral pattern. There are two concrete
observation vectors:

**Sybil attack on outbound tunnel first hops**

Each outbound tunnel's first hop sees all traffic entering that
tunnel from the sender's router. An adversary controlling the first
hop of more than one tunnel in the sender's pool observes traffic
stopping on one first hop and starting on another in close temporal
proximity, linking both tunnels to the same sender. With a pool of N
tunnels, an adversary controlling K first hops has a K/N probability
of observing any given switch event.

**Traffic-gap timing**

During the stall the client is not sending new data, so the old
outbound tunnel goes quiet. When the switch occurs, traffic resumes
on a different path. An adversary with a vantage point on the
sender's router — such as the sender's network provider, or the
first-hop node itself — can observe the silence-then-resumption
pattern. The gap duration additionally leaks an approximation of
the client's current retransmit timeout value.

Clients MUST comply with the rate-limiting and jitter requirements in
Triggers.
